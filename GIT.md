### Benefits of Git

To connecting to github create ssh-keygen.exe
Generate pablic/private rsa key pair.

- Speed: almost everything is done locally
- Distributed: it does not do a "checkout" of current source code like others VCS
- Data Assurance - every file has a checksum for data retrieval so data corruption is almost impossible
- Staging - has a local area and remote area
- Collaboration - extremely useful to have more than 1 developer on 1 project
